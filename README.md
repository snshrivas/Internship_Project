# Forest Cover Prediction

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project for predicting forest cover types based on various environmental features. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Introduction
Forest cover prediction is a crucial task in environmental science and conservation efforts. By analyzing environmental features such as elevation, soil type, and wilderness area, we can predict the type of forest cover in a given area. This information is valuable for land management, biodiversity assessment, and conservation planning.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various environmental features and their corresponding forest cover types. Each observation represents a 30x30 meter area of land in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado.

## Features
- Elevation
- Aspect
- Slope
- Horizontal and Vertical Distance to Hydrology
- Hillshade Index
- Wilderness Area (4 binary columns)
- Soil Type (40 binary columns)

## Machine Learning Pipeline
1. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features if necessary.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the distribution of features, identify correlations, and visualize relationships between variables.
3. Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
4. Model Training: Train machine learning models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks using the processed data.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model for real-world predictions using web applications, APIs, or other platforms.
